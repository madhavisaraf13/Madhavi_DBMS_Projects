In this project we need to develop a database tailored for analyzing incidents of bird strikes on aircraft, utilizing an available dataset containing more than 25000 records from the Federal Aviation Administration (in csv format).

The following steps were followed:
* I have crafted a logical data model
* Designed a relational schema
* Implemented the schema in MySQL/MariaDB
* Imported data from the csv file into the MYSQL database
* Executed SQL queries and conducting preliminary data analysis.

- Technologies: AWS RDS, R, MySQL
- Database concepts covered : Procedures, Triggers, Graph plotting(ggplot)
Please refer the PDF to see the code along with its execution.
